## Deployment

#### Running Code Locally
1. Follow this link to my [Repository on Github](https://github.com/FortyTwoFortyTwo/BuyGame) and open it.

2. Click `Clone or Download`.

3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click the `copy` icon.

4. In your local IDE open Git Bash.

5. Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be made.

6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

7. Press enter and your local clone will be ready.

8. Create and start a new environment:  
python -m .venv venv  
source env/bin/activate

9. Install the project dependencies:  
pip install -r requirements.txt

10. Create a new file, called `env.py` and add your environment variables:

import os  
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE", "secret key here")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET", "secret key here")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "secret key here")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "secret key here")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "secret key here")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "secret key here")

11. Go to `settings.py` file and add your environment variables.

12. Add `env.py` to .gitignore file

13. Go to terminal and run the following: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`, then `python3 manage.py migrate` to migrate all existing migrations to postgres database.

14. Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

15. Run it with the following command:  
`python manage.py runserver`

16. Open `localhost:8000` on your browser

17.  Add `/admin` to the end of the url address and login with your superuser account and create new products.

#### Deployment to Heroku

The following steps were taken in order to deploy this site to Heroku:

1. Created a new app in `Heroku` with a unique name, chose my region

2. Went to `Resources`, within Add-ons searched `Heroku Postgres`, chose Hobby Dev - Free version, then clicked `Provision` button.

3. In `Settings` clicked on `Reveal Config Vars` button, and copied the value of `DATABASE_URL`

4. Returned to terminal window and run `sudo pip3 install dj_database_url`

5. Also run `sudo pip3 install psycopg2`. Created a requirements.txt file using the terminal command `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

6. Went to `settings.py` and added `import dj_database_url` and updated `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))}` also updated `env.py` with `os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "postgres://postgres key - copied earlier from Heroku")`

7. I run `python3 manage.py makemigrations`, then `python3 manage.py migrate` to migrate all existing migrations to postgres database.

8. I created a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

9. Logged in to `Amazon AWS`, went to `S3` and created a new `S3` bucket.

10. Returned to terminal window and run `sudo pip3 install django-storages` and `sudo pip3 install boto3`. Went to `settings.py` and added `storages` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.

11. Also in `settings.py` the following lines are added:

AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {  
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',  
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000'  
}

AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'egg-sell-nt'  
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-1'  
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")  
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")  

AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = '%s.s3.amazonaws.com' % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME

12. Updated `env.py` with `AWS` keys (these keys are from `S3`).

13. Created `custom_storages.py` at the top level:

from django.conf import settings  
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
   location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
   location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

14. Went to `settings.py` and added:

STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'  
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'

MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'  
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'

15. Returned to terminal window and run `python3 manage.py collectstatic`

16. Returned to `Heroku`. In `Settings` clicked on `Reveal Config Vars` button, and added all the following config vars from `env.py`:

| Key         | Value | 
|:-------------:| :----: | 
|  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | secret key here  |
|  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | secret key here |
|  DATABASE_URL | secret key here |
|  DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC| 1 |
|  SECRET_KEY | secret key here |
|  STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE | secret key here |

17. Clicked to `Deploy`, then `GitHub`, searched for my repository and clicked to `Connect` button.

19. Created a `Procfile` using the following command: `echo web: gunicorn ms4.wsgi:application`

20. Ran `git add .`, `git commit -m "my commit message"` and `git push` commands to push all changes to my GitHub repository.

20. Returned to `Heroku` and hit `Deploy Branch`

21. Once the build is complete, click on `Open app`

22. Went to `settings.py` and added `egg-sell-nt.herokuapp.com` to `ALLOWED_HOSTS`

23. Ran `git add .`, `git commit -m "my commit message"` and `git push` commands to push all changes to my GitHub repository.
